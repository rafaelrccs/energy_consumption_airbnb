# Energy consumption airbnb

##Objective
Develop a energy consumption management solution to an Airbnb Host at no cost.

##Contextualization
 An Airbnb host asked me help about how he could monitor his guests energy consumption during each guest rental period.
 He was concerned because he was paying R$200,00/year for having a dashboard, indeed the problem was the dashboard was not customizable and was cluttered with too much information he doesn't need.
 Another problem was information update interval, the previous solution only provided the minimal interval of 30 minutes and he wanted 1 minute interval between measurements.
 
 He wanted to have a easy way of filterimng energy consumption by guest's entrance date and leave date.
 
 The host also wanted a free solution and wanted to parametize KWH price directly on the dashboard.
