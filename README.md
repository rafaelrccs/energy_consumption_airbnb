# Energy consumption Airbnb

## Objective
Develop a energy consumption management solution to an Airbnb Host at no cost.

## Contextualization
 An Airbnb host asked me help about how he could monitor his guests energy consumption during each guest rental period.
 Main problem statements were:
 -  He was concerned about current cost of R$200,00/year for having a dashboard, indeed the problem was the dashboard was not customizable and was cluttered with too much information he doesn't need.
 - Information update interval was not being achieved as well, the previous solution only provided the minimal interval of 30 minutes and he wanted 1 minute interval between measurements.
 - He wanted to have a easy way of filterimng energy consumption by guest's entrance date and leave date.
 - The host also wanted a free solution and wanted to parametize KWH price directly on the dashboard.
